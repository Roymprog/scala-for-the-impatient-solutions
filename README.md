# scala-for-the-impatient-exercises

This repository was created for me to have a central place to my solutions to the exercises of the book: "Scala for the Impatient (2nd Edition)" by Cay S. Horstmann. This is a great book to get into Scala, especially if you come from a Java world like me. 

By no means do I claim my solutions to be correct. If you have any suggestions you can create an issue or contact me personally to share your views. Interested in one of my solutions? Please do not hesitate to contact me.
