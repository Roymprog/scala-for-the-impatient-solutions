The ConsoleLogger trait has a new field added, which has to be injected into classes that mix in this trait. In order
for this to happen, all classes that mix in the trait have to be recompiled. Under the hood, the constructor of the
SavingsAccount class calls the $init$ method on the ConsoleLogger trait. After addition of the field and recompilation
of the file, the trait now expects a setter method "$_setter_$prepended_$eq" on the SavingsAccount class. If this class
would be recompiled, this method would be there, but SavingsAccount is not recompiled, so the method is not there and an
error is thrown explaining the method is abstract i.e. not implemented.
