In order to leverage the benefits of the composite pattern, JContainer has to extend JComponent, but in order to also
use the Java AWT Component class features it also has to extend Container. It is not possible to extend multiple classes
in Java, so the designers of Swing choose to make JComponent extend Container, and let JContainer extend JComponent.
In Scala it would be possible to implement JComponent as a trait and let "JContainer extend Container with JComponent",
thereby leveraging the functionality of both the Java AWT class and the JComponent trait. Or you could reimplement
Container as a Scala trait as well to mix in both traits for more flexibility.
